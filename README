1. Development Process

    ## Project Overview

        This project involved replicating an existing website using HTML, SASS, and JavaScript. The goal was to recreate the structure, styling, and interactive elements as closely as possible.

    ## Technology Stack

        HTML: Structure and layout

        SASS: Advanced styling and maintainability

        JavaScript: Interactive components (tabs, accordions, sliders, etc.)

        Slick Slider: Used for implementing sliders

        Lazy Loading: Implemented to improve page load speed and user experience


    ## Key Features

        Used HTML, SASS, and JavaScript for structuring and styling the webpage.

        Lazy Loading: Implemented to enhance page speed and crawl efficiency.

        Slick Slider: Integrated for a smooth slider experience.

        Mobile Responsiveness: Ensured adaptability across devices.

        Additional Image Animations: Enhanced user experience with animations.

2. Design Choices

    ## UI/UX Considerations

        Used SASS variables and mixins for consistency in colors, fonts, and spacing.

        Applied smooth transitions for hover effects and interactive elements.

    ## Component Reusability

        Tabs and accordions were created as reusable JavaScript modules.

        SASS mixins were used for consistent spacing and typography.

    ## Performance Optimizations

        Minimized CSS by compiling SASS efficiently.

        Used lazy loading for images to enhance page speed.

3. Challenges Faced & Solutions

    ## Logo Creation Using Letters

        Challenge: Designing a logo using only typography.

        Solution: Experimented with CSS transformations and SVG text manipulation to create a visually appealing logo using third party.

    ## Advanced Styling: Combined Tabs & Accordions

        Challenge: Merging tabbed navigation and accordions in a seamless way.

        Solution: Used nested styles and JavaScript event handling to ensure smooth transitions and user experience.

    ## Future Improvements

        Upgrade the project using React to improve maintainability and component reusability.

        Further refine SASS structure for even better maintainability.

        Enhance JavaScript interactivity with additional animations.
